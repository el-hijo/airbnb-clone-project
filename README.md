# Project Initialization- Airbnb Clone Project.
The Airbnb Clone Project  is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application. 

The objective of the project is to help learners:
1. Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
2. Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
3. Implement advanced security measures for API development.
4. Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
5. Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
6. Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

The tech stack for this project includes:
1. Django.
2. Django REST Framework.
3. PostgreSQL.
4. Celery.
5. Redis.
6. Docker.
7. CI/CD Pipelines. 

# Team Roles.
1. Business Analyst: A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder feedback to help a client formulate what their wants look like and align a customer’s vision with what a development team is producing. They translate an abstract product idea into a set of tangible requirements. The Business Analyst enriches a product development team with a profound understanding of business processes from various perspectives and the ability to shape up a software product that creates maximum business value.
2. Product Owner: A Product Owner is a decision-maker, who balances the both business needs and market trends, defines the  business strategy, shapes up the product vision, makes sure it satisfies customer needs, and manages a product backlog. A Product Owner provides the vision of a product without diving deep into the technicalities.
3. Product Manager: A Product Manager is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status. A Product Manager connects the dots between high-level stakeholder requirements and day-to-day task execution on a team.
4. UI/UX Designer:
   UI- A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. 
   UX- A UX designer is involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.
Both UI/UX designers work with the team throughout the development lifecycle, helping achieve business goals via functional and engaging user experiences, as well as analyzing, evaluating, and enhancing those experiences over time.
5. Software Architect: A Software architect is an expert-level software engineer who makes executive software design decisions on behalf of an app development team. A software architect decides which services and databases should communicate together, how integrations should work, and how to ensure that the product is secure and stable.
6. Software Developer: A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. A Software Developer can be Backend Developer or a Frontend Developer or both ie a Fullstack Developer.
   Backend Developer -  A Backend Developer implements the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic.
   Frontend Developer - A Frontend Developer creates the part of an application that users interact with.
7. Quality Assurance Engieer: A Quality Assurance Engineer verifies whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional. To keep track of the executed checks and ensure that all the requirements are covered with tests, QA Engineers may create different kinds of testing documentation—from test scenarios to test protocols to test results reports.
8. Test Automation Engineer: A Test Automation Engineer develops test automation scripts that provides reliable and continuous feedback on application quality without any human involvement. And makes sure that your test automation initiative generates as much value as possible at a reasonable cost.
9. DevOps Engineer: DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.
